# How to contribute to simplectemplate

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a Pull Request Process, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Fixing issues and Pull Request Process

* Creating a new branch off of the develop branch

### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/dafky2000/simplectemplate/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/dafky2000/simplectemplate/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Fix the bug on your feature / bug branch.
* Follow the project coding style, described below.
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Ensure your PR passes the automated Travis CI build process.

### **Coding Style**

* Use tabs, not spaces. If you like 4-space tabs, set your ```tabstop``` appropriately. Some (sane) people, like myself ;), like 2-space indentation and tabs suit everyone.
* Who cares about line width.. Comments, text and other non-readability impacting stuff (not code) can rely on word wrapping.
* All code should follow K&R style, with some caveats:
  * Opening braces should always be on the same line, even on function definitions.
  * You may omit braces for one-line if-statements, else, etc.

# **Do you have questions about the source code?**
